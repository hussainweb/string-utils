This application is designed as an utility in a developer's toolbox. It returns common information about string such as length, length in bytes, etc... You can directly type/paste the text or load it from a file.

Shortly, I will implement features such as counting whitespace, alphanumeric characters, etc... After that, I will be adding in support for calculating hashes of the string. Suggestions are welcome.

I have started checking-in the source for this project. Right now, it hardly has any utility at all. It is meant to be a kind of template for more features on the way. For this reason, I have not put up binaries for this yet. I will put up the first build when it is worth using.

## Features
Quickly find out basic information such as length of the string.

## Upcoming Features
- Calculate character distribution in a string.
- Regex tester
- Hashing
- Encryption
- and more...
